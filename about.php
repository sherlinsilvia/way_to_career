<h1>HISTORY OF ENGINEERING</h1>
<p>Engineering has existed since ancient times, when humans devised inventions such as the wedge, lever, wheel and pulley, etc.
The term engineering is derived from the word engineer, which itself dates back to the 14th century when an engine'er 
(literally, one who builds or operates a siege engine) referred to "a constructor of military engines".[7] In this context,
 now obsolete, an "engine" referred to a military machine, i.e., a mechanical contraption used in war 
 (for example, a catapult). Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present 
 day are military engineering corps, e.g., the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
The word "engine" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the Latin ingenium (c.1250), 
meaning "innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention."[8]
Later, as the design of civilian structures, such as bridges and buildings,
 matured as a technical discipline, the term civil engineering[6] entered the lexicon as a way
to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the
discipline of military engineering.</p>
<h1>MAIN BRANCHES</h1>
<h3>CHEMICAL ENGINEERING</h3>
<p>Chemical engineering is the application of physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering principles in order to carry out 
chemical processes on a commercial scale, such as the manufacture of commodity chemicals, specialty chemicals, 
petroleum refining, microfabrication, fermentation, and biomolecule production.
<h3>Civil engineering</h3>
<p>Civil engineering is the design and construction of public and private works, 
    such as infrastructure (airports, roads, railways, water supply, and treatment etc.),
     bridges, tunnels, dams, and buildings.[59][60] Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a
      number of sub-disciplines, including structural engineering, environmental engineering, and surveying.
       It is traditionally considered to be separate from military engineering.[61]</p>
<h4>Many branches of engineering are developed nowadays like AI and other departments..</h4>
